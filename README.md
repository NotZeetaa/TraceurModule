# TraceurModule

Devices running Android 9 (API level 28) or later include a system-level app called System Tracking.
This app is similar to the command line utility systrace, but it allows you to record tracks directly
from a test device, without having to connect the device via cable and ADB.
You can use the app to share the results of these tracks with your development team.

## What this do if i disable tracing?
If u disable tracing the "services" which start tracking ur system
will stop and this can save a bit of ur battery and other things
